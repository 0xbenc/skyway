# Contributing to Skyway

:+1::tada: First off, thanks for taking the time to contribute! :tada::+1:

The following is a set of guidelines for contributing to Skyway.
These are just guidelines, not rules, use your best judgment and feel free to
propose changes to this document in a pull request.

## Issues

Current issues are found [here](https://electronjs.org/docs/development/issues).
Create a new issue [here](https://github.com/0xbenc/skyway/issues/new).

Label your issue with ```bug```, ```documentation```, ```ehancement```, ```help wanted```,
or ```question``` labels.

Put your issue in the ```backlog``` milestone.

### Issue Closure

Bug reports will be closed if the issue has been inactive and the latest affected
version no longer receives support.

_If an issue has been closed and you still feel it's relevant,
feel free to ping a maintainer or add a comment!_

### Languages

We accept issues in _any_ language.
When an issue is posted in a language besides English,
it is acceptable and encouraged to post an English-translated copy as a reply.
Anyone may post the translated reply.
In most cases, a quick pass through translation software is sufficient.
Having the original text _as well as_ the translation can help mitigate translation errors.

Responses to posted issues may or may not be in the original language.

## [Pull Requests](https://electronjs.org/docs/development/pull-requests)

Pull Requests are the way concrete changes are made to the code, documentation,
dependencies, and tools contained in the `0xbenc/skyway` repository.

Start by forking the project on GitHub and clone your fork locally.

Your issue will be assigned a milestone.

Create a branch off of ```development``` titled after your issue or milestone (or both).

Commit your changes.

Test your changes on as many platforms as possible.

Create a pull request from your forked repository's feature branch
into the ```development``` branch of the original repository.

Your pull request will be reviewed and integrated into a future version of Skyway.
