            A seed phrase is a series of words that unlocks your Skyway data and
            Skyway password. It works like a master password that can help you
            recover your app and password if you ever forget. To safely store
            your seed phrase, you should write it down on a piece of paper and
            keep it in a secure place that only you know.
          </Typography>

            phrase again.
